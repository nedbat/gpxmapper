GPX Mapper
##########

A quick program to map a number of .gpx files.  

I've been walking during the 2020 pandemic with my son.  We start and end at
our house, doing about 5 miles each time.  To keep it interesting, I've tried
to walk on new streets each time, and walk on "every" street.

Each day is mapped as a .gpx file.  This code produces an animated gif of the
walks:

You can see the results:
